v0.10.02
--------
* Removed responsibility of storage/retrieval of DataMap from Encrypt/DecryptDataMap methods.
* Changed EncryptDataMap to take ValidationData.
* Re-added private_key_id parameter to EncryptDataMap.
* Removed unnecessary try catch blocks.
* Removed extra parameter from EncryptDataMap.
* Removed call to function that no longer exists in SignedData
* Changed EncryptDataMap and DecryptDataMap to accommodate new ChunkActionAuthority in Private.
* Updated ctest config file in sync with project name change.
* Further fixes to Encrypt.
* Corrected logic in test.
* Ensured consistency of reported processors to SelfEncrypt during tests' executions.
* Addressed much of issue #4
* Randomised number of processors set in ctor of SelfEncryptor during tests.
* Fixed issue #3.
