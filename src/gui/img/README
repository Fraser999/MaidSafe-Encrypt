image handling

to compile images into the app 
add image to img directory (to keep it clean)
use high quality images (or we look daft)

add the image to the images.xrc file (use same format)

from the command line type 
wxrc -c -o images.cc images.xrc (on windows use /c /o instead of -c -o)


thats it 

to use the image in the app type
 
wxBitmap bitmap = wxXmlResource::Get()->LoadBitmap(wxT(“bmp1”));

or for html pages etc. 
htmlWindow->LoadPage("memory:XRC_resource/resources.cpp$about.html");
